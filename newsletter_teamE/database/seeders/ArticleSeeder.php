            The company, which launched in Canada in 2014, has six Nordstrom stores and seven Nordstrom Rack locations.
            
            All stores will close and all the company's staff in Canada â€” roughly 2,330 people â€” will lose their jobs, the company said Thursday.
            
            In court filings, the company says Nordstrom's Canadian business has lost money every single year it has been in operation.
            Gift cards will be honoured until the end of liquidation for in-store purchases. No new gift cards can be purchased after Thursday.

            The company's Nordstrom.ca site has stopped sales effective immediately. Any orders placed online before Thursday will be filled, but no new orders will be processed online. After March 17, all sales are final and returns and exchanges will no longer be permitted.",

            The board says sales for the month in the area it covers totalled 1,808, down from 3,424 in February 2022 and roughly 33 per cent below the 10-year February sales average.
            
            The board says the numbers reflect a continued reluctance from prospective home sellers to list their properties, pushing sales well below historical norms.
            
            However, the total number of homes listed for sale in the region has continued inching upwards, moving up by 16.7 per cent from February 2022 and 5.2 per cent from January 2023.",
